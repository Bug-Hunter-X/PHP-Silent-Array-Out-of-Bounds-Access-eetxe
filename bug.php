In PHP, a common but subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly strings.  If you try to access an array element using a numeric key that PHP interprets as an integer, and this integer key is outside the bounds of the numerically indexed array, you might not get a proper `undefined index` error, leading to unexpected behavior. Instead, PHP might silently treat it as the key '0' if the array is numerically indexed.

For example:

```php
$myArray = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

echo $myArray[3]; // This might output "apple", not an error.
```

The reason is that PHP automatically converts the numerical index 3 to its string equivalent ("3").  If there's a key "3" it will be used. Otherwise, if it's a numerical array, it will be coerced to index 0.

This differs from languages like JavaScript where accessing an index outside the array bounds throws an error directly.
